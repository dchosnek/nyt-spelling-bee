.SYNOPSIS
    This script builds a text dictionary of English words with no special characters.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script builds a dictionary for use with The New York Times Spelling 
    Bee puzzle, so all words are have a minimum length of four and contain no
    no-alpha characters (no spaces, dashes, punctuation, etc.). Additionally,
    the dictionary excludes words that have more than seven unique characters
    since the NYT puzzle only specifies seven letters each day.

.EXAMPLE
    Example of how to use the script:
    ./build-dictionary.ps1

.NOTES
    Additional notes about the script.
